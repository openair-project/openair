#' Function to calculate time averages for data frames
#'
#' Function to flexibly aggregate or expand data frames by different time
#' periods, calculating vector-averaged wind direction where appropriate. The
#' averaged periods can also take account of data capture rates.
#'
#' This function calculates time averages for a data frame. It also treats wind
#' direction correctly through vector-averaging. For example, the average of 350
#' degrees and 10 degrees is either 0 or 360 - not 180. The calculations
#' therefore average the wind components.
#'
#' When a data capture threshold is set through `data.thresh` it is necessary
#' for [timeAverage()] to know what the original time interval of the input time
#' series is. The function will try and calculate this interval based on the
#' most common time gap (and will print the assumed time gap to the screen).
#' This works fine most of the time but there are occasions where it may not
#' e.g. when very few data exist in a data frame or the data are monthly (i.e.
#' non-regular time interval between months). In this case the user can
#' explicitly specify the interval through `interval` in the same format as
#' `avg.time` e.g. `interval = "month"`. It may also be useful to set
#' `start.date` and `end.date` if the time series do not span the entire period
#' of interest. For example, if a time series ended in October and annual means
#' are required, setting `end.date` to the end of the year will ensure that the
#' whole period is covered and that `data.thresh` is correctly calculated. The
#' same also goes for a time series that starts later in the year where
#' `start.date` should be set to the beginning of the year.
#'
#' [timeAverage()] should be useful in many circumstances where it is necessary
#' to work with different time average data. For example, hourly air pollution
#' data and 15-minute meteorological data. To merge the two data sets
#' [timeAverage()] can be used to make the meteorological data 1-hour means
#' first. Alternatively, [timeAverage()] can be used to expand the hourly data
#' to 15 minute data - see example below.
#'
#' For the research community [timeAverage()] should be useful for dealing with
#' outputs from instruments where there are a range of time periods used.
#'
#' It is also very useful for plotting data using [timePlot()]. Often the data
#' are too dense to see patterns and setting different averaging periods easily
#' helps with interpretation.
#'
#' @param mydata A data frame containing a `date` field . Can be class `POSIXct`
#'   or `Date`.
#' @param avg.time This defines the time period to average to. Can be `"sec"`,
#'   `"min"`, `"hour"`, `"day"`, `"DSTday"`, `"week"`, `"month"`, `"quarter"` or
#'   `"year"`. For much increased flexibility a number can precede these options
#'   followed by a space. For example, a timeAverage of 2 months would be
#'   `period = "2 month"`. In addition, `avg.time` can equal `"season"`, in
#'   which case 3-month seasonal values are calculated with spring defined as
#'   March, April, May and so on.
#'
#'   Note that `avg.time` can be *less* than the time interval of the original
#'   series, in which case the series is expanded to the new time interval. This
#'   is useful, for example, for calculating a 15-minute time series from an
#'   hourly one where an hourly value is repeated for each new 15-minute period.
#'   Note that when expanding data in this way it is necessary to ensure that
#'   the time interval of the original series is an exact multiple of `avg.time`
#'   e.g. hour to 10 minutes, day to hour. Also, the input time series must have
#'   consistent time gaps between successive intervals so that [timeAverage()]
#'   can work out how much 'padding' to apply. To pad-out data in this way
#'   choose `fill = TRUE`.
#' @param data.thresh The data capture threshold to use (%). A value of zero
#'   means that all available data will be used in a particular period
#'   regardless if of the number of values available. Conversely, a value of 100
#'   will mean that all data will need to be present for the average to be
#'   calculated, else it is recorded as `NA`. See also `interval`, `start.date`
#'   and `end.date` to see whether it is advisable to set these other options.
#'
#' @param statistic The statistic to apply when aggregating the data; default is
#'   the mean. Can be one of `"mean"`, `"max"`, `"min"`, `"median"`,
#'   `"frequency"`, `"sum"`, `"sd"`, `"percentile"`. Note that `"sd"` is the
#'   standard deviation, `"frequency"` is the number (frequency) of valid
#'   records in the period and `"data.cap"` is the percentage data capture.
#'   `"percentile"` is the percentile level (%) between 0-100, which can be set
#'   using the `"percentile"` option --- see below. Not used if `avg.time =
#'   "default"`.
#'
#' @param type `type` allows [timeAverage()] to be applied to cases where there
#'   are groups of data that need to be split and the function applied to each
#'   group. The most common example is data with multiple sites identified with
#'   a column representing site name e.g. `type = "site"`. More generally,
#'   `type` should be used where the date repeats for a particular grouping
#'   variable. However, if type is not supplied the data will still be averaged
#'   but the grouping variables (character or factor) will be dropped.
#' @param percentile The percentile level used when `statistic = "percentile"`.
#'   The default is 95%.
#' @param start.date A string giving a start date to use. This is sometimes
#'   useful if a time series starts between obvious intervals. For example, for
#'   a 1-minute time series that starts `2009-11-29 12:07:00` that needs to be
#'   averaged up to 15-minute means, the intervals would be `2009-11-29
#'   12:07:00`, `2009-11-29 12:22:00`, etc. Often, however, it is better to
#'   round down to a more obvious start point, e.g., `2009-11-29 12:00:00` such
#'   that the sequence is then `2009-11-29 12:00:00`, `2009-11-29 12:15:00`, and
#'   so on. `start.date` is therefore used to force this type of sequence.
#' @param end.date A string giving an end date to use. This is sometimes useful
#'   to make sure a time series extends to a known end point and is useful when
#'   `data.thresh > 0` but the input time series does not extend up to the final
#'   full interval. For example, if a time series ends sometime in October but
#'   annual means are required with a data capture of >75 % then it is necessary
#'   to extend the time series up until the end of the year. Input in the format
#'   yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM.
#' @param interval The [timeAverage()] function tries to determine the interval
#'   of the original time series (e.g. hourly) by calculating the most common
#'   interval between time steps. The interval is needed for calculations where
#'   the `data.thresh` >0. For the vast majority of regular time series this
#'   works fine. However, for data with very poor data capture or irregular time
#'   series the automatic detection may not work. Also, for time series such as
#'   monthly time series where there is a variable difference in time between
#'   months users should specify the time interval explicitly e.g. `interval =
#'   "month"`. Users can also supply a time interval to
#'   *force* on the time series. See `avg.time` for the format.
#'
#'   This option can sometimes be useful with `start.date` and `end.date` to
#'   ensure full periods are considered e.g. a full year when `avg.time =
#'   "year"`.
#' @param vector.ws Should vector averaging be carried out on wind speed if
#'   available? The default is `FALSE` and scalar averages are calculated.
#'   Vector averaging of the wind speed is carried out on the u and v wind
#'   components. For example, consider the average of two hours where the wind
#'   direction and speed of the first hour is 0 degrees and 2m/s and 180 degrees
#'   and 2m/s for the second hour. The scalar average of the wind speed is
#'   simply the arithmetic average = 2m/s and the vector average is 0m/s.
#'   Vector-averaged wind speeds will always be lower than scalar-averaged
#'   values.
#' @param fill When time series are expanded, i.e., when a time interval is less
#'   than the original time series, data are 'padded out' with `NA`. To
#'   'pad-out' the additional data with the first row in each original time
#'   interval, choose `fill = TRUE`.
#' @param progress Show a progress bar when many groups make up `type`? Defaults
#'   to `TRUE`.
#' @param ... Additional arguments for other functions calling [timeAverage()].
#' @import dplyr
#' @export
#' @return Returns a data frame with date in class `POSIXct`.
